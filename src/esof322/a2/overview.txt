Changes made: We modified AdventureGameModelFacade.java so that it made the correct calls that were origionally made in AdventureGame.java
	This accomplishes the task of creating and starting a new instance of a game with a gui interface as well as leaving the AdventureGame.java fully functional 
	so that the text version of the game can still be run or the gui. We modified AdventureGameView.java to include a text field in the gui so the player can 
	choose which item to grab or drop from the room or inventory. We have also added the grab and drop methods that are required for the gui to function correctly 
	with the game.

Interesting class relationships: The class AdventureGameModelFacade.java has relationships with player, adventure, and room because it creates new instances of them 
	when the game is run.

Design approaches: We started by planning the design so that most of the existing code would be left the same and the text version of the game would still work.
	Another design approach was to use the existing AdventureGame.java as a resource when writing the code for AdventureGameModelFacade.java.

Things that gave us trouble: Not looking at all of the code that is executed in each function so we did not know everything that was being done when it was run. For 
	example when picking up or dropping an item, the items are automatically added and removed from the room so we had duplicates at first and then realized what was happening.

Special instructions for running program: Import an external jar (BreezySwing) into the project file path. Run the program by selecting AdventureGameModelFacade.java 
	from the run menu.
	When playing the game use the text field to enter the number of the item that you wish to pick up or drop and then click the button of the action you 
	want to do (pick up or drop).

Time spent by each team member: Tim Wegher 3 hours, Nevin Leh 5 hours, Aaron Newhall 5 hours
